Message-based object-oriented design
------------------------------------------

Event-driven design
-------------------------

Asynchronous design
---------------------------

.. TODO App, services, objects, states, and operations
.. TODO State management and state inconsistency warnings: even if an operation
.. (like settings a window size) succeeds, the size will not necessarily change
.. to the specified value or even change at all. The most reliable way of
.. tracking object's states is handling events.
