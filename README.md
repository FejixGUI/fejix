# Fejix graphical client library

Fejix is a cross-platform C99 base library for clients of graphical shells.
Its goal is to wrap graphical shell protocols (Windows API, Wayland, X11 etc.) to provide a common
base for GUI toolkits.

Fejix can perform tasks like window management, graphical API initialisation,
input and more.
