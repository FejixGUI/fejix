# Fejix - a graphical client library

Fejix is a cross-platform low-level C99 library for graphical client applications.
Its goal is to wrap graphical shell protocols (Windows API, Wayland, X11 etc.) to provide a common
base for cross-platform GUI toolkits, game engines and other tools.

Fejix can perform tasks like window management, graphical API initialisation,
input and more.
